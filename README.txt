PCAP Sentry (Offline GUI)

PCAP Sentry is an offline malware analysis console for PCAP files. It parses
network captures, summarizes traffic statistics, and provides heuristic
signals to help triage suspicious activity. The app can optionally use a
local LLM for narrative analysis when configured.

Notes
- Large PCAP files can take several minutes to parse.
- App data is stored under the user profile if the install directory is not
  writable.

Support
If you encounter issues, capture logs from the build process and note the
steps to reproduce the problem.
